# 3rd Workshop on DevOps support for Cloud FPGA platforms

## Why is cFDevOps important?

With the slowdown of Moore's law as we know it, the Cloud is resorting to heterogeneous, accelerated computing to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for performance and power efficiency. In just a few years, FPGAs have emerged as compute accelerators next to GPUs and are part of the standard offerings from many Cloud vendors. However, the development environment, deployment procedures, security measures, and monitoring tools are different for each platform and the portability of FPGA kernel designs remains limited. 

In this workshop, leading platform providers, designers of development environments, and developers present the state-of-the-art for Cloud FPGA platforms and explore opportunities and directions for future improvements from the developer's point of view. Instead of focusing on the performance and optimization of a specific application, the goal of this workshop is to highlight the challenges, which a Cloud application developer faces when designing, implementing, deploying, scaling and debugging Cloud services on Cloud FPGA platforms. 

A focus area for this years edition are end-to-end tool chains including compilation as well as the runtime environment for heterogeneous platforms. 


## Program

The workshop will take place on  **Thursday, September 1st, 14:00h - 18:00h GMT+1** (local Belfast time). The workshop will be held in a **hybrid mode**, allowing speakers and participants to join on-site or remote. Details will be updated here.
